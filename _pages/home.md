## ProSumers using 3D printing processes

  <!-- <summary>Zusammenfassung Punkt 1</summary> -->
  <p>People produce their own food by using CD printing. They purchase different ingredients (pure ressources), get the program (= menue) from the internet and produce nice and very different meals on their own.</p>

## Local Food Circles producing together

<details>
  <!-- <summary>Zusammenfassung Punkt 1</summary> -->
  <p>As formulated by the Food Circles Network: A Food Circle is a new way of conceiving and organizing our agricultural and food systems. It links the many people involved in food pro-duction together in interdependent, holistic ways. Practically, a Food Circle is concerned with promoting the consumption of safe, regionally grown food that will encourage sustainable agriculture and help to maintain farmers, who will sustain rural areas. While the concept sounds simple, it means that we must radically change the way we participate in the act of growing and consuming food. In countries around the world a number of social innovations are emerging around this vision of localised chains of food production and consumption.</p>

## Time and Food processing

{% raw %}
<details>
    <p>People more and more think that they "do not have time", especially for thinking about their food, and preparing adequate meals with healthy and good quality food. There are attempts to make users more aware of the time spent of Food processing and preparation. There is a project, in which learners explore the use of time in the preparation and consumption of food. This is from the perspective of social relationships in families and the effects of food consumption on the global environment. Learners are helped to envision new and more sustainable ways of consum-ing food to help to bring about some changes in their actions to promote responsible living.</p>

## Food is not grown, anymore

{% raw %}
<details>
    <p>Soil is scarce and agriculture as we know it today, is a hazard game. Climate change brought us to the point that it is difficult to grow food. It is too hot. The soil dried up and no matter how much artificial irrigation farmers provide it is never the same. Leafy green vegetables struggled to grow and simply didn’t produce anymore. Cruciferous vegetables are completely stunted in their development. Chard and beetroots barely survived to September when they flourish again. There-fore, most food is processed and artificially produced food, based on chemistry, 3D printing or just ingredients that were not used for food, before (e.g. cellulose from the forests).</p>

## Organic farming and no-processing only

{% raw %}
<details>
    <p>Organic farming is a trend and most of the society wants to go back to "natural food", "healthy food". Different movements support this and processed food is not en vogue or completely banned. Especially salty and sweet processed food is banned from the supermarkets in most EU countries.</p>

## Customization of products

{% raw %}
<details>
    <p>The paradigm of mass customization emerged in the late 1980´s, as the demand for product vari-ety increased. A continued move away from mass production with virtually identical products to increased customization, in which customers demand the product to be manufactured to their exact requirements. Customizing also requires the delivery of products and services within much shorter periods. The main drivers are plural life forms between tradition and modernity; this also relates to globally concurring value systems and the development of hybrid cultures, e.g., chang-ing family orders and life forms as well as the increasing “do it yourself”-movement and economy. Food is also customized and not used as it grows, anymore.</p>
